# Slice and Dice - simple API to derive simplified summary statistics (mean, min, max)

##Requirements

- [x] An API to add a new record to the dataset.
- [ ] Document the case to run both insertions in the README.
- [x] An API to delete a record from the dataset.
- [ ] Document the case to run both deletion in the README.
- [x] Load example dataset into the DB.
- [x] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary over the entire dataset. You can ignore the currency (if not mentioned otherwise) of the salary and simply treat salary as a number.
- [ ] Document the case to run both fetches in the README.
- [ ] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary for records which satisfy "on_contract": "true".
- [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.
- [ ] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary for each department. This means that whatever youâ€™ll do in Step 3, should be done for each department. The return of this API should have 1 summary statistics available for each unique department.
- [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.
- [ ] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary for each department and sub-department combination. This is similar to Case 5 but 1 level of nested aggregation.
- [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.
- [ ] Bootstrap the project in Docker: **docker-compose.yml** in the root folder; **docker-compose up** should be able to run the service
- [ ] Implement basic authentication (any user name and password)
- [ ] Implement basic authorization (any user name and password)
- [x] Input should be validated against their schema
- [ ] Error handling & the proper HTTP code should be added when authentication fails
- [ ] Error handling & the proper HTTP code should be added when authorization fails
