# Slice and Dice - simple API to derive simplified summary statistics (mean, min, max)

##Requirements

1. [x] An API to add a new record to the dataset.
   - [ ] Document the case to run both insertions in the README.
2. [x] An API to delete a record from the dataset.

   - [ ] Document the case to run both deletion in the README.
   - [x] Load example dataset into the DB.

3. [x] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary over the entire dataset. You can ignore the currency (if not mentioned otherwise) of the salary and simply treat salary as a number.

   - [x] Fetch summary statistics for a specific currency.
   - [ ] Document the case to run both fetches in the README.

4. [x] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary for records which satisfy **on_contract: "true"**(passed in as query parameter).

   - [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.

5. [ ] An API to fetch summary statistics for salary for each department. This means that whatever youâ€™ll do in Step 3, should be done for each department. The return of this API should have **1 summary statistics available for each unique department**.

   - [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.

6. [ ] An API to fetch **summary statistics for salary for each department and sub-department combination**. This is similar to Case 5 but 1 level of nested aggregation.

   - [ ] document the case to run both fetches in the README.

7. [ ] Bootstrap the project in Docker: **docker-compose.yml** in the root folder; **docker-compose up** should be able to run the service

8. [ ] Implement basic **authentication**(any user name and password)

   - [ ] Implement basic **authorization**(any user name and password)

9. [x] Input should be **validated against their schema**

10. [ ] **Error handling & the proper HTTP code** should be added when authentication fails
    - [ ] **Error handling & the proper HTTP code** should be added when authorization fails
